        <p>
        Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.</p>

        <p>
        The complete set of rules is extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court. The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively.Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally.</p>

        <header>Origin of the Game</header>
        <p>
        In December 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts (United States), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette, a name derived from the game of badminton, as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from other sports such as baseball, tennis and handball. Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>
          A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents' court.</li><br>
          <li>
          In case of a serving error, a second try was allowed. Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul (with loss of the point or a side-out) except in the case of the first-try serve.</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School, the game quickly became known as volleyball. The rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs.</p>
        <p>
          In the early 1900s Spalding, through its publishing company American Sports Publishing Company, produced books with complete instruction and rules for the sport.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="gameplay">
        <header>Gameplay</header>
        <p>
          To get play started, a team is chosen to serve by coin toss. A player from the serving team throws the ball into the air and hit the ball so it passes over the net on a course such that it will land in the opposing team's court (the serve). The opposing team must use a combination of no more than three contacts with the volleyball to return the ball to the opponent's side of the net. These contacts usually consist first of a pass so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the setter; second of the set (usually an over-hand pass using wrists to push finger-tips at the ball) by the setter so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one of the players designated as an attacker can hit it, and third by the attacker who spikes (jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent's court) to return the ball over the net.</p>

        <p>
          The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offence. The team on defence attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court. Players at the net jump and reach above the top (and if possible, across the plane) of the net to block the attacked ball. If the ball is hit around, above, or through the block, the defensive players arranged in the rest of the court attempt to control the ball with a dig (usually a fore-arm pass of a hard-driven ball). After a successful dig, the team transitions to offence. The game continues in this manner, rallying back and forth until the ball touches the court within the boundaries or until an error is made.</p>
          
        <p>
          A ball is "in" if any part of it touches the inside of a team's court or a sideline or end-line, and a strong spike may compress the ball enough when it lands that a ball which at first appears to be going out may actually be in. Players may travel well outside the court to play a ball that has gone over a sideline or end-line in the air.</p>

        <header>Players And Equipments</header>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each team has 6 players on a court at any one time. Substitutes can be used throughout the game. There are no professional mixed sex teams. Each player takes up a position in either the attacking zone (next to the net) or the defensive zone (at the back of the court). Three players are in each zone and rotate in a clockwise position after every point.
          </li><br>

          <li>
            The court is of a rectangular shape and measures 18m x 9m. Running across the court is a 2.43m high net with the ball measuring 8 inches in diameter and weighing between 9 and 10 ounces. Around the outlines of the court is an out of bounds area and if the ball were to bounce in these sections then a point would be awarded to the opposing team.

      <section class="main-section" id="player_specialization">
        <header>Player Specialization</header>
        <p>There are five positions filled on every volleyball team at the elite level. These are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Setter</li>
          <li> Libero / Defensive Specialist</li>
          <li> Middle Hitter / Middle Blockers</li>
          <li> Outside Hitter / Left Side Hitter</li>
          <li> Opposite Hitter / Right Side Hitter</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Each of these positions plays a specific, key role in winning a volleyball match. Below is the deatil of their function:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Setters</strong><br>
            Setters have the task for orchestrating the offence of the team. They aim for the second touch and their main responsibility is to place the ball in the air where the attackers can place the ball into the opponents' court for a point. They operate with the hitters, manage the tempo of their side of the court and choose the right attackers to set. Setters need to have a swift and skilful appraisal and tactical accuracy and must be quick at moving around the court.
          </li><br>

          <li><strong>Libero / Defensive Specialist</strong><br>
            Liberos are defensive players who are responsible for receiving the attack or serve. They are usually the players on the court with the quickest reaction time and best passing skills. Libero means 'free' in Italian and they receive this name as they have the ability to substitute for any other player on the court during each play. they have a strong passing and defensive skills to excel in the position and play an important role in the team's success. Liberos wear a different colour jersey than their teammates.
          </li><br>

          <li><strong>Middle Hitter / Middle Blockers</strong><br>
            Middle blockers or Middle hitters are players that can perform very fast attacks that usually take place near the setter. They are specialized in blocking since they must attempt to stop equally fast plays from their opponents and then quickly set up a double block at the sides of the court. At elite levels, every team has two middle hitters and they are usually the tallest players.
          </li><br>

          <li><strong>Outside Hitters / Left Side Hitters</strong><br>
            Outside hitters or left-side hitters, attack from near the left antenna. The outside hitter is usually the most consistent hitter on the team and gets the most sets. Inaccurate first passes usually result in a set to the outside hitter rather than middle or opposite. Since most sets to the outside are high, the outside hitter may take a longer approach, always starting from outside the court sideline. At elite levels, there are two outside hitters on every team in every match and they are have the best defensive skills, therefore always re-placing to the middle while in the back row.
          </li><br>

            <li><strong>Opposite Hitters / Right Side Hitters</strong><br>
              Opposite hitters or right-side hitters carry the defensive workload for a volleyball team in the front row. Their primary responsibilities are to put up a well-formed block against the opponents' Outside Hitters and serve as a backup setter. Sets to the opposite usually go to the right side of the antennae. They are usually the most technical hitters since balls lifted to the right side are quicker and more difficult to handle and also having to jump from the back row when the setter is on the front row.
            </li><br>
          </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="scoring">
        <header>Scoring</header>
        <p>
        A point is scored when the ball contacts the floor within the court boundaries or when an error is made: when the ball strikes one team's side of the court, the other team gains a point; and when an error is made, the team that did not make the error is awarded a point, in either case paying no regard to whether they served the ball or not. If any part of the ball hits the line, the ball is counted as in the court. The team that won the point serves for the next point. If the team that won the point served in the previous point, the same player serves again. If the team that won the point did not serve the previous point, the players of the team acquiring the serve rotate their position on the court in a clockwise manner. The game continues, with the first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin awarded the set. Matches are best-of-five sets and the fifth set, if necessary, is usually played to 15 points. Scoring differs between leagues, tournaments, and levels; high schools sometimes play best-of-three to 25; in the NCAA matches are played best-of-five to 25 as of the 2008 season.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="skills">
        <header>Skills</header>
        <p>
        Competitive teams master six basic skills: serve, pass, set, attack, block and dig. Each of these skills comprises a number of specific techniques that have been introduced over the years and are now considered standard practice in high-level volleyball.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Serve</strong><br>
          A player stands behind the inline and serves the ball, in an attempt to drive it into the opponent's court. The main objective is to make it land inside the court; it is also desirable to set the ball's direction, speed and acceleration so that it becomes difficult for the receiver to handle it properly. A serve is called an "ace" when the ball lands directly onto the court or travels outside the court after being touched by an opponent; when the only player on the server's team to touch the ball is the server. The types of serves employed includes: Underhand serve, Sky ball serve, Topspin, Float serve, Jump serve,
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>Pass</strong><br>
           Pass also called reception, the pass is the attempt by a team to properly handle the opponent's serve or any form of attack. Proper handling includes not only preventing the ball from touching the court but also making it reach the position where the setter is standing quickly and precisely. The skill of passing involves fundamentally two specific techniques: Underarm pass (bump) , Overhand pass, 
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>Set</strong><br>
          The set is usually the second contact that a team makes with the ball. The main goal of setting is to put the ball in the air in such a way that it can be driven by an attack into the opponent's court. The setter coordinates the offensive movements of a team, and is the player who ultimately decides which player will actually attack the ball. The types of set employed include: Jump set, Front set, Back set,
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>Attack</strong><br>
          The attack, also known as the spike, is usually the third contact a team makes with the ball. The object of attacking is to handle the ball so that it lands on the opponent's court and cannot be defended.A player makes a series of steps (the "approach"), jumps, and swings at the ball. The hitter uses arm swing, wrist snap, and a rapid forward contraction of the entire body to drive the ball. A 'bounce' is a slang term for a very hard/loud spike that follows an almost straight trajectory steeply downward into the opponent's court and bounces very high into the air. A "kill" is the slang term for an attack that is not returned by the other team thus resulting in a point. Contemporary volleyball comprises a number of attacking techniques including: Backcourt/Back row, Dip/Dink/Tip/Cheat/Dump, Tool/Wipe/Block-abuse, Off-speed hit, Quick hit/"One", Slide, Double quick hit/Stack/Tandem,
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>Block</strong><br>
          Blocking refers to the actions taken by players standing at the net to stop or alter an opponent's attack.
          A block that is aimed at completely stopping an attack, thus making the ball remain in the opponent's court. It requires anticipating the direction the ball, calculating the best footwork and taking a timed jump to intercept the ball's trajectory prior to it crossing over the plane of the net. The main types of block are offensive block (roof block) and defensive block (soft block). Blocking is also classified according to the number of players involved. Thus includes single (or solo), double, or triple block.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>Dig</strong><br>
          Digging is the ability to prevent the ball from touching one's court after a spike or attack, particularly a ball that is nearly touching the ground. In many aspects, this skill is similar to passing, or bumping. However it varies from passing because it is a much more reflex based skill. Examples of the dig includes: "dive", pancake,
